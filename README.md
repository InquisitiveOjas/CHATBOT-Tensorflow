# CHATBOT-Tensorflow
A learning attempt on making Chatbots using tensorflow.

"Chatbots will power 85% of all the customer service interactions by 2020"

Following points are needed to be kept in mind while creating a Chatbot so that it works perfectly or more like a human :-
  (1) Volume of the conversations
  (2) Consistency of the agents
  (3) Training the agents
  (4) Length of conversations
  (5) Complexity of incoming and outgoing questions.

Some applications of Chatbots :-
  (1) Ordering Food
  (2) Real Estate
  (3) Booking Tickets (example : Flight Bookings)
  (4) Product Selection
  (5) Healthcare (Providing the information we may require during a medical emergency like the nearest hospital or their working hours or medicine delivery servies etc..)

Workflow of a Chatbot :-
  (1) Determing the role of the bot.
  (2) Creating the conversational architecture.
  (3) Getting a variety of questions.
  (4) Pick a plattform and a development approach.
  (5) Implementation of the dialog flow and engineering the natural language understanding.
  (6) Internal testing and revising the use-case detection. Creation should be an iterative process.
